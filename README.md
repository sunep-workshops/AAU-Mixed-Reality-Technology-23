This is the repository for sharing files and have instructions, links and documentation for Mixed Reality technologies 2023.

The course modules on Fridays September 29 and October 6 will mainly focus on getting started with vvvv gamma. This will be done through examples using projection mapping and tracking with kinect.

Over time, many have speculated about what the meaning of vvvv could be. in december 2022 I asked the ChatGPT oracle what the meaning is and got a great reply. It has been confirmed by the creators of vvvv to be correct.

I tried asking again today, and I just got a boring and not very good reply

This is the repository for sharing files and have instructions, links and documentation for Mixed Reality technologies 2023.

The course modules on Fridays September 29 and October 6 will mainly focus on getting started with vvvv gamma. This will be done through examples using projection mapping and tracking with kinect.

## Instructions before the first module on September 29
### Get a mouse!
If you don't have a mouse, get one.

Patching using a track pad is possible, but really annoying, even on a good trackpad.
Get one with:
- 3 buttons (most times, the scroll whell act as middle button)
- scroll whell (can you even get one without scroll wheel these days?)

[Have everyting installed and working](/docs/BeforeTheWorkshop.md)

[Useful links](/docs/UsefulLinks.md)

[Patch](/patches/Welcome.vl) of the welcome image - download the patch and run after you have followed the instructions above to install vvvv gamma.

## About vvvv
the official description is:
>*A visual live-programming environment that takes you from rapid prototyping to final production.*

When talking about vvvv, few people say *"Vee Vee Vee Vee"*, but rather *"four vee"*, *"Vee four"*. Since lots of german speakers use vvvv, *"Vau Vier"* is also pretty common. But when writing, people just use *vvvv*.

Over time, many have speculated about what the meaning of vvvv could be. in december 2022 I asked the ChatGPT oracle what the meaning is and got a great reply. It has been confirmed by the creators of vvvv to be correct.

I tried asking again today, and I just got a boring and not very good reply

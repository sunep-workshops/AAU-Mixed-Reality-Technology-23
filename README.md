This is the repository for sharing files and have instructions, links and documentation for Mixed Reality technologies 2023.

The course modules on Fridays September 29 and October 6 will mainly focus on getting started with vvvv gamma. This will be done through examples using projection mapping and tracking with kinect.

[Practical info](/docs/Practical.md) when working with mapping and kinect can be found [here](/docs/Practical.md)

## Instructions before part two of the workshops on October 6
- Most important go watch the two videos and patch along to the two videos from the [NODE20](https://nodeforum.org/activities/festival/node20/) festival that I have highlighted under [Useful Links](/docs/UsefulLinks.md).
- second, check out if you can get the kinect 360 working the library for that has been updated to work with the current version of dotnet, so it should work now. If you can get it to work, then Thomas have plenty for everyone at the lab.
- Play around with gamma and see if you can begin making a skeleton of what you want this semesters installation to do. Then we can discuss that on Friday
- make a github account if you don't have one already
- Install github desktop and clone this repository (or another client if you have one that you prefer)
- post questions as [issues](https://github.com/sunep-workshops/AAU-Mixed-Reality-Technology-23/issues)
- Make a repository for your semester project and invite you group mates and supervisors to it. You just need one repository per group.

## Instructions before the first module on September 29
### Get a mouse!
If you don't have a mouse, get one.

Patching using a track pad is possible, but really annoying, even on a good trackpad.

Get a mouse with:
- 3 buttons (most times, the scroll whell act as middle button)
- scroll whell (can you even get one without scroll wheel these days?)

[Have everyting installed and working](/docs/BeforeTheWorkshop.md)

[Useful links and how to find help](/docs/UsefulLinks.md)

[Patch](/patches/Welcome.vl) of the welcome image - you can download the patch and run it after you have followed the instructions above to install vvvv gamma and the extra packages.

## About vvvv
the official description is:
>*A visual live-programming environment that takes you from rapid prototyping to final production.*

When talking about vvvv, few people say *"Vee Vee Vee Vee"*, but rather *"four vee"*, *"Vee four"*. Since lots of german speakers use vvvv, *"Vau Vier"* is also pretty common. But when writing, people just use *vvvv*.

Over time, many have speculated about what the meaning of vvvv could be. in december 2022 I asked the ChatGPT oracle what the meaning is and got a great reply. It has been confirmed by the creators of vvvv to be correct.

I tried asking again today, and I just got a boring and not very good reply

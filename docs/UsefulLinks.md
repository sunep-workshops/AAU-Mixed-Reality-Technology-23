# Useful Links

## vvvv links
- https://visualprogramming.net/ - where you get vvvv Gamma and read the [Blog](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/)
- https://vvvv.org/ where you create a user and post on [the Forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/)
- https://matrix.to/#/#vvvv:matrix.org - the live chat, active most of the time, lots of vvvv users are nigh owls and/or live in other time zones than CET.
    - [Element.io](https://element.io/download) is a favoured matrix client and the chat is often referred to as the element chat.

### Learning
The Node Institute have a bundle with the recordings of all the workshop at NODE20. While the version of vvvv they are using is old, the concepts are still totally valid (Exept for the few workshops that use vvvv beta)
- https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/node20-vvvv-workshop-bundle/

Mainly these two videos in this order:
- [Introduction to vvvv-gamma for designers](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/node20-vvvv-workshop-bundle/lessons/getting-started/topic/introduction-to-vvvv-gamma-for-designers/) See where I got the idea for having you guys patching on the projector.
- [Object Oriented Patching](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/node20-vvvv-workshop-bundle/lessons/vl-language-methodologies/topic/object-oriented-patching/) It's not as scary as it sounds.

## Great utilities
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - the git client I use. feel free to use other clients if you so prefer, as long as you know how to use them.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - an excelent text editor, integrates very well with github desktop

## Finding help

When you first start vvvv, it looks something like this:
![Alt text](/img/GammaStart.png)
To the right you have the help browser.
If you click the Learn tab, you can search in everything that is installed and have a help patch. eg. Kinect.

I will recommend that you look around and see what is possible, there is a lot of good inspiration to be found.
### The Gray Book
You also have the Gray Book https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/ which collects some documentation.
Note

## Community
However cool vvvv is, the very best thing about it, is the community, lot's of extra functionality is developed by members of the community and the community is very welcoming to new users.
So join the community and be active. You actually have a community that is genuinely positive and including.
- The fastest way to get help if you are stuck, is to post in the chat: https://app.element.io/#/room/#vvvv:matrix.org
- In the chat, you will often be asked to create a forum post with a deeper explanation https://discourse.vvvv.org/
So my recommendation is to create a user account on vvvv.org as well as lingering around in the chat, sometimes there is quite interesting info that might not be directly relevant, but interesting or cool or something that will help you avoid problems in the future.
